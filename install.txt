**********************************
  INSTALLING CLIMPACT2
**********************************

Software you will need:
-R
-NCO (for the time being),

In R you will need the following packages:
-climdex.pcic
-ncdf4
-PCICt
-SPEI

**********************************

To download the code to the storm servers by the following steps:

1) Create a new directory
2) CD to above directory and run "git clone git@github.com:heroldn/climpact2.git"
	NOTE: if the above address doesn't work try https://github.com/heroldn/climpact2.git.

To run the code:

1) Load the R module if you don't already have it "module load R/3.0.3 nco/4.3.2" -> I added nco here for a meta-data hack I've got in place.
2) In R install the following packages (note if you already have climdex.pcic installed you will need to remove it with remove.packages("climdex.pcic"));
    - install.packages("/file/path/to/climdex.pcic.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")
    - install.packages("ncdf4")
    - install.packages("PCICt")
    - install.packages("SPEI")
3) Edit and run test.climpact2.r. More information can be gleaned from the climpact.loader function header in climpact2_0.1.r.

This should be all you need to run the software, but apologies if I've missed something (let me know).

MORE DETAILS:

There are numerous parameters that can be specified in climpact.loader. However, the only necessary data needed is at least one filename for either the min temperature, max temperature or precipitation, and a list of one or more indices to calculate.

Some sample NarClim data are already specified along with the bare minimum parameters.

The indices can be specified by their abbreviation in lower case (you can see the valid indices in index.master.list). E.g. TX95t should be called with tx95t. 

The following indices are new and should work (in addition to any of the original climdex indices):
fd2	Annual count when TN < 2ºC
fdm2	Annual count when TN < -2ºC
fdm20	Annual count when TN < -20ºC
tm5a	Annual count when TM >= 5ºC
tm5b	Annual count when TM < 5ºC
tm10a	Annual count when TM >= 10ºC
tm10b	Annual count when TM < 10ºC
su30	Annual count when TX >= 30ºC
su35 	Annual count when TX >= 35ºC

Where TN = minimum daily temperature, TX = maximum daily temperature and TM = average daily temperature.

Feel free to load in any other gridded data that has daily values. A big assumption here is that all files sent to climpact.loader are from the same source and have the same time and space dimensions.
